# WeTrace: A Fight against COVID-19

- COVID-19 has been the nightmare for Mankind. Tracing COVID has not been possible for well-structured organizations and even by the government. 
  COVID Tracing has become very important to fight against the outbreak, so we took the initiative to come up with an Android Application which can track, 
  trace and test the novel coronavirus. We created a Self-Assessment Test using COVID Symptoms, that is capable of evaluating the risk of COVID-19 in the user. 

- The data is then used to track the user and provide safety tips and recommendations. Using the Track Module, the user is notified with the containment zones nearby. 
  The contact tracing module helps the user to maintain the specified distance with others.
